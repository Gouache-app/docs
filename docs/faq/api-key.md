# Api key

In order to use our [useGouache](https://github.com/Gouache-app/use-gouache) React hook that allow you to make live changes into your application, you'll need to get an API key.

### How to get your project's API key?

You need to go to the root of your project and click on the more button on the left of your project title. Then click on `Settings` to see your API key. To copy it to use it with the [useGouache](https://github.com/Gouache-app/use-gouache), you only need to click on it.
