# Project

At gouache, everything starts with a `Project`. A project is where you'll be building the infrastructure of your Design System or simply store your application styles.

### How to reate a Project?

Creating a project is pretty simple using Gouache. Once you're authenticated using your One Time Password, you'll be redirected to the `projects page`.

From there, you need to click on the `Create project` button.

You'll need to add a name for your project and you'll need to select a template. 

If it's your first project, you might want to try the `Recommended` template to get you up and running quickly.

Once you'll be more comfortable and if you think the `Recommended` file structure did not meet your need, you can use the `Blank` template and start from scratch.

### How to delete a project?

From the root of the project, you can use the more button to delete your project. Right now, please note that a project needs to be empty in order to be deleted.
