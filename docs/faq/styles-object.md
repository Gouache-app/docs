# Styles object

On Gouache, the Styles object is the object that contains all of your styles for a particular project. 

### Downloading your styles object

If you want to see how your styles object looks and if you want to use a local styles file in production instead of making API calls to get your styles object, you can download it as a JSON file.

To do so, go to the root of your project and click on the more button on the left of your project title. Then click on `Download styles object` to download your styles object as a JSON file.

The output you're seeing is then the same format as the one you're using with out [useGouache](https://github.com/Gouache-app/use-gouache) react hook.
