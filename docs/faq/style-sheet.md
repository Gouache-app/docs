# Style sheet

A Style Sheet is a document that store styles values. Inside this file, you can store css styles, use design tokens as style variable or import an existing style sheet as a reusable block.

In the example above, to style our primary button, we're using the `default button` reusable block and we're adding a `blue` background-color and a `white` color (both stored as Design Tokens).

### How to create a Style Sheet?

To create a Style Sheet, click on the top right `Add` button and select `Style Sheet`.

### How to edit Style Sheet?

Editing a style sheet is pretty similar than how to edit styles using the `Chrome devtool`. The difference here is that you can use your `Design tokens` and add `Reusable blocks`Â (i.e. previously saved Style Sheets).
