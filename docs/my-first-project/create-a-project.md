# Create a Project

Creating a project is pretty simple using Gouache. Once you're authenticated using your One Time Password, you'll be redirected to the `projects page`.

From there, you need to click on the `Create project` button.

You'll need to add a name for your project and you'll need to select a template. 

If it's your first project, you might want to try the `Recommended` template to get you up and running quickly.

<iframe width="560" height="315" style={{margin: "40px 0px"}} src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yB1eLVB94S4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Once you'll be more comfortable and if you think the `Recommended` file structure did not meet your need, you can use the `Blank` template and start from scratch.
